##From 04/10 - 04/17

## Instructions: 

Build a (mini) command line app in the browser. You can use a front-end framework if you'd like, and/or a boilerplate generator.

You can create this fully in the front-end, or create a back-end API. You don't need to create real files, just simulate the command line functionality using a data structure you think makes sense.

You should implement at least a few basic commands (cd, mkdir, touch, ls), and add any additional commands you'd like.

Please send us your app in a zip file, and include a README file with instructions on how to install and run the app. Please don't post your solution on Github.

We ask that you complete this within the next week (4/13), but you can submit it sooner if you'd like.
